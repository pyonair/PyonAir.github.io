# Power supply

Our Grove socket PCB design includes 3 different power input options: DC barrel jack \(2.1 mm\), JST/LiPo or screw terminal. The onboard voltage regulator can convert any input voltage from 6.5 V - 32 V. We recommend choosing a power supply that can provide 1 A or more.

__When assembling, make sure to remove all covers (e.g. plastic covers in battery pack).__
