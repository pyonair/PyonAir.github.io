# Case

Our PCB design is perfectly compatible with most 90 mm wide electronics enclosures. The example case is 115 x 90 x 55 mm and is large enough for all of the components, but you may wish to increase the size to make adding air inlets and future upgrades either. We recommend a 115 x 90 x65 mm case, with external mounting holes, like the one shown below.

Depending on your needs - such as installation site and additional hardware - you may wish to design your own case for the PM sensor system instead.

Additional advice can be found on the [Deployment page](../../tutorial/deployment.md#case-advice).
