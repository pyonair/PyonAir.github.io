# Introduction

The PyonAir is a low cost system for monitoring local air pollution levels. Based around the Pycom LoPy4 board and Grove-compatible hardware, our system can transmit data over both LoRa and WiFi. The sensors we have implemented measure particulate matter \(PM\) air pollution.

## Project Aim

The aim of the PyonAir project is to deploy a network of low-cost, IoT pollution monitors that will allow us to gather crucial information about the distribution and causes of air pollution. By making the project open-source, with easy setup instructions, we hope to make the PyonAir device accessible to anyone who is interested in air quality, either personally or professionally. For example, this device can be used to collect data for student projects, PhDs and independent parties, making vital research that has a reputation for soaring costs much more attainable. The project may also be used for outreach purposes, communicating with members of the public about their local air quality and the steps that can be taken to improve it.

### Our goals

* Low power consumption
* Flexibility
* Ease of use
* Clear setup guidance
* Low cost

## Design

Our goals of simplicity and ease of use inspired our decision to use the Grove system as the backbone of our design. The wide range of compatible modules will allow users of our system to customise the PyonAir device to their needs, without being forced to redesign the fundamental hardware. Meanwhile, Pycom's LoPy4 offers multiple options for wireless communication in a single, neat package.
